    content: "There's a lot of confusion in federal tech circles about how FedRAMP, the DoD Impact Levels (IL2-IL6), and the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program all relate to one another; especially for AI and software companies trying to sell into the government.\n\nSome tech leaders tell me: We don't see any opportunities on eBuy for what we sell. Others assume: We have IL6, so we should automatically qualify for FedRAMP, right?\n\nLet's clear this up. Understanding these frameworks is crucial for any software company looking to succeed in the federal marketplace. Each certification serves a different purpose and opens different doors in government contracting.\n\nThe relationship between these frameworks is more nuanced than many realize, and getting it right can mean the difference between winning contracts and missing opportunities."

    content: "Many vendors believe they need years of federal experience before applying to GSA's Multiple Award Schedule program. This misconception costs companies valuable opportunities.\n\nThe truth is that the GSA Schedule is more accessible than most companies think. While having federal experience can be helpful, it's not a requirement. What matters more is your ability to demonstrate past performance, competitive pricing, and a solid business foundation.\n\nAnother common myth is that small businesses can't compete on the Schedule. In reality, GSA actively encourages small business participation and offers specific support programs to help smaller vendors succeed in the federal marketplace."

    content: "The key to winning federal proposals isn't just technical excellence—it's demonstrating you understand the agency's mission and challenges.\n\nSuccessful proposals speak directly to the agency's pain points and clearly articulate how your solution addresses their specific needs. Too many companies focus on listing features and capabilities without connecting them to outcomes that matter to the evaluators.\n\nYour proposal should tell a story: the agency has a challenge, your solution solves it, and here's the evidence that proves you can deliver. Back everything with concrete examples, metrics, and past performance that demonstrates your capability."

          <p className="hero-intro">Most companies think a GSA Schedule will generate sales automatically. It won't. MAS performs only when it's aligned, maintained, and guided by someone who understands the doctrine—and your CO will not do that for you. If your contract is quiet, misaligned, or at risk of cancellation, you're not alone. CSP brings former-GSA insight and Marine-grade discipline to correct course and build a federal revenue engine that actually works.</p>
